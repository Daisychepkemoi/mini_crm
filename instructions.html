Basically, project to manage companies and their employees. Mini-CRM.
The application should achieve the following objectives.
Basic Laravel Auth: ability to log in as administrator

Use database seeds to create first user with email admin@admin.com and password “password”

CRUD functionality (Create / Read / Update / Delete) for two menu items: Companies and Employees. - Done

Companies DB table consists of these fields: Name (required), email, logo (minimum 100×100), website

Employees DB table consists of these fields: First name (required), last name (required), Company (foreign key to Companies), email, phone

Use database migrations to create those schemas above

Store companies logos in storage/app/public folder and make them accessible from public

Use basic Laravel resource controllers with default methods – index, create, store etc. - Done

Use Laravel’s validation function, using Request classes

Use Laravel’s pagination for showing Companies/Employees list, 10 entries per page

Use Laravel make:auth as default Bootstrap-based design theme, but remove ability to register

Email notification: send email whenever new company is entered (use Mailgun or Mailtrap)

Deploy the application Heroku.

Bonus but Optional
Basic testing with phpunit (I know some would argue it should be the basics, but I disagree)
